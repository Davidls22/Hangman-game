# Hangman-game

Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a classic word guessing game where you try to guess the letters of a secret word before you run out of guesses.

How to Play

The game begins with a secret word, which is displayed on the screen as a series of blank spaces. The number of blank spaces corresponds to the number of letters in the word or phrase.

The player's goal is to guess the word or phrase by suggesting letters one at a time.

After each guess, the game will indicate whether the guessed letter appears in the word or phrase. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in its correct position(s) in the word or phrase. If the letter is incorrect, a part of the hangman drawing will be added to the screen.

The game continues until the player successfully guesses the word or phrase, or until the hangman drawing is completed.

However, there is a limit to the number of incorrect guesses a player can make (10 guesses). If the player exceeds the limit, the game ends, and the player loses.

Once the game is over, the player has the option to play again with a new word or phrase.

That's it! Have fun playing the Hangman game!
